# Analyzing-Global-Seismic-Activities
Significant Earthquakes from 1965-2016 and Date, time, and location of all earthquakes with magnitude of 5.5 or higher.

# Aim of the Analysis

The aim is to analyze and study the Regions and Countries which faced and experienced most seismic activities and Earthquakes with the help of various __Visualizations and statistical techniques__ which will explain lots of hidden trends and finding out the reason behind those seismic activities.

# Introduction and Context

 The National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC) determines the location and size of all significant earthquakes that occur worldwide and disseminates this information immediately to national and international agencies, scientists, critical facilities, and the general public. The NEIC compiles and provides to scientists and to the public an extensive seismic database that serves as a foundation for scientific research through the operation of modern digital national and global seismograph networks and cooperative international agreements. The NEIC is the national data center and archive for earthquake information.
    
    
    
# Content

The dataset includes a record of the date, time, location, depth, magnitude, and source of every earthquake with a reported magnitude 5.5 or higher since 1965 to 2016.
